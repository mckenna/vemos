## Virtual movie nights made easy

Vemos is a Chrome extension for making virtual movie nights with friends so much better.
The goal is to make it feel like you and your friends are all in the same room when watching movies online, even if you're thousands of miles apart.

Vemos supports Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Hulu, Disney+ and Plex.
If you've suggestions for more services, let me know and I can see if it works out of the box.

## [You can download it from the Chrome Webstore here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vemos/pbonnafeomejlkdmjlealabfanohjogh)

Vemos is written using PeerJS and EmberJS.
